# Introduction to Windshield Safety
Windshield safety is a critical aspect of vehicle maintenance, often overlooked until it's too late. A damaged or improperly installed windshield can lead to a range of problems, from decreased visibility to increased risk of injury in the event of an accident.

## Why Windshield Safety Matters
* A windshield provides up to 60% of a vehicle's structural integrity in a rollover accident
* Properly installed auto glass can help prevent ejection from the vehicle in the event of a crash
* A clear, undamaged windshield is essential for maintaining visibility while driving

## Types of Auto Glass
* **Laminated Glass**: Consists of two layers of glass with a layer of PVB (polyvinyl butyral) in between, providing excellent strength and resistance to penetration
* **Tempered Glass**: A type of safety glass that is heat-treated to increase its strength and durability
* **Acoustic Glass**: Designed to reduce wind noise and provide a more comfortable driving experience

## Choosing the Right Auto Glass
When selecting a new windshield or repairing a damaged one, consider the following factors:
* **Quality of Materials**: Look for OEM (original equipment manufacturer) or OEM-equivalent glass for the best results
* **Installation Method**: Ensure the installer uses the latest techniques and materials for a secure, leak-free fit
* **Warranty and Support**: Choose a reputable company that offers a comprehensive warranty and dedicated customer support
