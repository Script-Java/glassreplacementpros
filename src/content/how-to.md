# How to Care for a Newly Replaced Windshield and Back Glass

A newly installed windshield Back Glass is an investment in your safety and your vehicleâ€™s integrity. Taking the right steps immediately after replacement ensures your glass stays strong and clear for years to come.

## 1. **Wait Before Driving**

After installation, adhesives need time to cure. Generally, you should wait at least **one hour** before driving away.

> **Safety Tip:** Ask your technician for the recommended wait time.

## 2. **Avoid Car Washes**

High-pressure water, brushes, or chemicals can weaken the adhesive seal while it cures. Avoid:

* Car washes for at least 48 hours.
* High-pressure hoses near the glass edges.

> **Care Tip:** Gentle hand washes are safest in the first week.

## 3. **Keep Windows Cracked Open**

Heat buildup and air pressure can strain fresh seals. Leave windows slightly open (about an inch) for the first 24-48 hours to prevent this.

> **Pro Tip:** This also helps prevent water leaks during rain.

## 4. **Avoid Slamming Doors**

Slamming doors creates air pressure inside the cabin that can disturb the curing adhesive. For the first few days:

* Gently close doors.
* Avoid rough road conditions when possible.

> **Maintenance Note:** This helps ensure a tight, uniform seal around your windshield Back Glass.

## 5. **Leave Retention Tape in Place**

Installers often use tape to hold the molding in place while the adhesive sets. Do not remove it for at least 24-48 hours.

> **Reminder:** It may not look great, but it helps guarantee a proper fit and finish.
