# Introduction to Windshield Safety
Windshields play a crucial role in vehicle safety, providing protection from external elements and contributing to the structural integrity of a vehicle. In the event of an accident, a windshield can be the difference between life and death. 
## The Role of Auto Glass in Vehicle Protection
* **Prevents Ejection**: In the case of a rollover or severe collision, the windshield helps prevent the occupants from being ejected from the vehicle, reducing the risk of fatal injuries.
* **Maintains Vehicle Structure**: Auto glass helps maintain the vehicle's structural integrity, ensuring the roof does not collapse in the event of a rollover.
* **Protects from External Elements**: Windshields shield occupants from wind, rain, and debris while driving.
## Types of Auto Glass
There are two primary types of auto glass: laminated and tempered. 
* **Laminated Glass**: Used for windshields, laminated glass consists of multiple layers, including a layer of polyvinyl butyral (PVB), which holds the glass together in the event of a collision.
* **Tempered Glass**: Used for side and rear windows, tempered glass is designed to shatter into small, blunt pieces in the event of a collision, reducing the risk of injury.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, windshield safety is a critical aspect of vehicle protection. By understanding the role of auto glass in preventing ejection, maintaining vehicle structure, and protecting from external elements, vehicle owners can appreciate the importance of proper windshield maintenance and repair.
