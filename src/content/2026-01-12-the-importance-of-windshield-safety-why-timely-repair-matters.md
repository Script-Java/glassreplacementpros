### Introduction to Windshield Safety
Windshield safety is a crucial aspect of vehicle maintenance that is often overlooked until it becomes a pressing issue. A damaged windshield can compromise the structural integrity of your vehicle and pose significant risks to you and your passengers.

### Why Windshield Safety Matters
* **Prevents Accidents**: A clear and undamaged windshield ensures that you have an unobstructed view of the road, reducing the risk of accidents caused by poor visibility.
* **Maintains Vehicle Integrity**: The windshield plays a critical role in the overall structure of your vehicle. Damage to the windshield can weaken the vehicle's frame, making it more susceptible to collapse in the event of a rollover.
* **Enhances Safety Features**: Modern vehicles are equipped with advanced safety features like airbags and lane departure warning systems. A damaged windshield can hinder the effectiveness of these features.

### Signs You Need Windshield Repair
* **Chips and Cracks**: Even minor damage can spread and lead to more extensive problems if not addressed promptly.
* **Visual Obstructions**: Any damage that obstructs your view of the road is a safety hazard.
* **Leaks or Water Damage**: If your windshield is leaking or showing signs of water damage, it's a sign that the seal has been compromised.
